# Automated Testing with JavaScript

Here are my learnings from the Udemy Course - [JavaScript Unit Testing](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-unit-testing-the-practical-guide/) - to use for future reference when writing tests.

## Types of Testing

### Unit Testing

Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of an application in isolation to ensure they work as expected. These tests are typically written by developers and focus on the smallest parts of the application.

### Integration Testing

Integration testing checks how different modules or services in an application work together. It ensures that the interactions between integrated units function correctly and that data flows between them as expected.

### End-to-End (E2E) Testing

End-to-end testing simulates real user scenarios to validate the entire application flow from start to finish. It tests the complete application, including its interactions with external systems, to ensure that everything works together as intended.

## Testing Setup

- **Test Runner** to automatically detect testing code and executes it in development environment and then displays the results, e.g. `Jest`, `Karma` or `Vitest`
- **Assertion Library** to define expected testing outcomes and to check whether these are met (in sync and async modes), e.g. `Jest`, `Chai` or `Vitest`

_Note:_ `Jest` works better with `CommonJS` vs. `ES Modules`. It only supports ECMA Scripts as experimental. Therefore using `Vitest` (that also uses `Jest` syntax) is recommended.

**1. Install Vitest**

```bash
npm install --save-dev vitest
```

**2. Update Test Script in `package.json`**

```json
"scripts": {
    "test": "vitest --global" }
```

or

```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest --run --reporter verbose" }
```

**3. Install dependencies for each directory**

```bash
cd directory-name
npm install
```

## Examples

### [frontend-testing-esmodules](./frontend-testing-esmodules/)

Uses plain JS with **ES modules** with `import` / `export` syntax
and with `type="modules"` in HTML script tag

### [backend-testing-nodejs-commonjs](./backend-testing-nodejs-commonjs/)

Uses `node.js` with **common** JS with `require` / `module.exports` syntax

### [backend-testing-nodejs-esmodules](./backend-testing-nodejs-esmodules/)

Uses `node.js` with **ES modules** with `import` / `export` syntax and with `  "type": "module"` in `package.json`

## Testing Basics

- **Identifying Units** - Search for functions or pieces of code that are isolated and do not call other functions. These will often be exported as well.

- **Create Test File** - for that particular unit you want to test. This is the default process for `jest`. Name the file same as the original but with the infix `.test` or `.spec`, e.g. unit contained in file `math.js` -> will get `math.test.js` test file.

- **Insource Testing** - as alternative to having a separate file. The tests could also be written in the same file as the unit. This is a `vitest` feature.

- **Import** - the `test` (or `it`) and `expect` function from `vitest` or `jest`. When using `--global` flag with the `vitest` command, these global functions do not need to be imported every time but are available globally. However, the import will provide auto-completion when writing code.
  Also import the unit function that we want to test.

- **Calling** the `it` or `test` function. **First parameter** is a string that defines what is being tested and what the expectations are in a short and concise manner. **Second parameter** is a callback function that executes the unit function. It also calls the `expect` function with the result from the unit function execution. This is chained with a method that describes what the expected outcome should be (success criteria).

```javascript
it("should summarize all numbers in a given array", () => {
  const result = add([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
  expect(result).toBe(15);
});
```

- **Run your tests** - given the correct `package.json` [configuration](#testing-setup), you should be able to just run `npm test` in the CLI (in the directory of the `package.json`) to run the tests. Can also be run in watch mode with `npm run test:watch` (press `q` to quit).

## AAA Principle

The **AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert)** principle is a widely used pattern in unit testing that helps organize tests in a clear and structured way. By separating each step of the test, it becomes easier to understand what the test is doing and why. The principle consists of three main steps:

### 1. Arrange

- **Definition:** The setup phase where you prepare all necessary conditions and inputs for the test.
- **Explanation:** In this step, you initialize any objects, set up dependencies, and define the inputs that the test will use. This preparation helps isolate the functionality being tested, ensuring that any external dependencies or state will not affect the outcome.
- **Example:** Creating a new instance of a class or setting specific variable values.

### 2. Act

- **Definition:** The execution phase where the functionality or method under test is invoked.
- **Explanation:** This is the step where you call the method or function you are testing with the arranged inputs. The goal here is to focus only on the action being tested, separating it from setup and validation to make the test more readable.
- **Example:** Calling a method like `calculateTotal()` on the arranged instance.

### 3. Assert

- **Definition:** The verification phase where you check the results of the action against expected outcomes.
- **Explanation:** In this final step, you validate that the result of the action matches the expected result. It determines which results lead to the test having succeeded or failed. This is where assertions are made to verify that the functionality works as intended, providing feedback if the outcome is incorrect.
- **Example:** Using assertions such as `expect().toBe()` to confirm that the test passes.

### Example

```javascript
it("should summarize all numbers in a given array", () => {
  // Arrange
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const expectedResult = numbers.reduce((prev, curr) => {
    return prev + curr;
  });
  // Act
  const result = add(numbers);
  // Assert
  expect(result).toBe(expectedResult);
});
```

## Testing for Errors

Basic unit tests only check return values. However, errors are not return values and therefore need to be tested for differently. This could be done using a `try`/`catch` block or wrapping the function to be tested in another function that can then be called by `vitest` or `jest`.

```javascript
it("should throw error if no input provided", () => {
  const resultFunction = () => add();
  expect(resultFunction).toThrowError();
});
```

or

```javascript
it("should throw error if no input provided", () => {
  try {
    add();
  } catch (error) {
    expect(error).toBeInstanceOf(Error);
  }
});
```

### Testing for specific Errors

The `expect` assertion can check the error message for a specific string, class instance of an error type or even a regex expression.

```typescript
toThrowError(expected?: string | Constructable | RegExp | Error): void
```

For example, if we want to check that an error is thrown that contains a specific wording:

```javascript
expect(resultFunction).toThrowError(/is not iterable/);
```

## Testing for Opposites

Using the `not` keyword will negate an assertion. For example, this code asserts that an input value is not equal to 2. If it's equal, the assertion will throw an error, and the test will fail.

```javascript
it("should not return 2 when calculating the square root of 16", () => {
  const input = Math.sqrt(16);
  expect(input).not.toBe(2);
});

it("should not throw error if no input provided", () => {
  const resultFunction = () => add();
  expect(resultFunction).not.toThrowError();
});
```
